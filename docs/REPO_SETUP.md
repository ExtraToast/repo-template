# Bootstrapping a new ExtraToast repo from this template

1. **Create the repo from the template** (GitHub "Use this template", or
   `gh repo create ExtraToast/<name> --template ExtraToast/repo-template
   --private`).
2. **Apply the branch ruleset** so `Pipeline Complete` is required:
   ```bash
   scripts/apply-ruleset.sh ExtraToast/<name>
   ```
3. **Wire the real CI**: replace the placeholder `lint`/`test`/`coverage`/`build`
   jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with this repo's actual jobs (or calls
   into reusable workflows from `ExtraToast/github-workflows`). Keep the
   `pipeline-complete` aggregator and list every gating job in its `needs:`.
4. **Wire the coverage gate**: every repo must enforce **>=80% line coverage**.
   - Gradle: apply JaCoCo and run `jacocoTestCoverageVerification` with a line
     coverage minimum of `0.80`.
   - Node: run Vitest with c8 coverage enforcement, for example `c8 --lines 80
     vitest run`.
5. **Set the release artifact**: edit `release.yml`'s `publish` job for this
   repo's artifact type (Maven / npm / image), and set `release-type` in
   `release-please-config.json` accordingly. New GitHub Packages publish as
   public on this account, but verify package visibility after the first
   publish.
6. **Set the starting version** in `.release-please-manifest.json`.
7. **CODEOWNERS / README**: adjust owners and replace this README's body with
   the repo's purpose.
8. **Choose dependency policy depth**:
   - Keep the root `renovate.json` and `.github/dependabot.yml` for the default
     ExtraToast policy.
   - Copy richer stack-specific variants from `templates/dependency-policy/`
     when the repo needs Dependabot ecosystems, dependency-review, Scorecard, or
     advanced CodeQL setup.
9. **Choose root tooling presets** from `templates/root-tooling/` when the repo
   has frontend linting, local hooks, ADRs, or docs indexes.
10. **Review Docker pattern skeletons** in `templates/docker-patterns/` only as
    design references. They are not production Dockerfiles.
11. **Validate template assets**:
    ```bash
    scripts/validate-templates.sh
    ```
